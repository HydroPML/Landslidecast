  This repository contains 1D and 2D codes for predicting landslide dynamic processes. Model training, testing and fine-tuning are implemented in the main program landslide_1d or landslide_2d. 
  In the 1d folder of the 1D code are the prediction results for the three sections of the Baige landslide. The Landslide folder of the 2D code contains the prediction results for the 2D of the Baige landslide.
