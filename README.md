This repository contains 1D and 2D datasets based on the depth-integrated method, as well as 1D and 2D codes for predicting landslide dynamic processes. Model training, testing and fine-tuning are implemented in the main program landslide_1d or landslide_2d. You can use our dataset to train new models.
